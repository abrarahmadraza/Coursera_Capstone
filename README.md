## Introduction

**Chennai**, often referred to as **"The Detroit of India"**, is a bustling city with diverse neighborhoods. As a business owner, choosing the right location for your establishment is crucial. This project leverages data science techniques to help you make informed decisions.

## Business Problem

The central question we address is: **Where should you establish your business in Chennai?** To answer this, we consider factors such as neighborhood characteristics, existing venues, and local demographics.

## Data Sources

We utilize the following data sources:

1. **Neighborhood Data**: A dataset containing a list of neighborhoods in Chennai along with their latitude and longitude coordinates.
2. **Foursquare API**: We access venue information within each neighborhood, including restaurants, hotels, shopping centers, and more.

## Methodology

Our approach involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
    - Gather neighborhood data and explore its structure.
    - Set up the Foursquare API connection.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Clean and organize the neighborhood data.
    - Retrieve venue information using Foursquare.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
    - Understand the distribution of venues across neighborhoods.
    - Identify popular venue categories.

4. **Clustering**:
    - Apply **k-means clustering** to group neighborhoods based on venue similarity.
    - Determine the optimal number of clusters using silhouette scores.

5. **Visualization**:
    - Use the **Folium library** to display clusters on a map of Chennai.
    - Highlight areas suitable for specific business categories.

## Results

The project provides actionable insights for business owners:
- **Clustered Neighborhoods**: Explore neighborhoods grouped by venue similarity.
- **Venue Recommendations**: Identify areas with high restaurant density, hotel availability, or shopping centers.
- **Visual Map**: View clusters overlaid on a map of Chennai.

## Usage

2. Install the necessary Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`neighborhood_battle.ipynb`) to reproduce the analysis.
