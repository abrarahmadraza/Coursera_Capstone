Introduction
Chennai, often referred to as ‚ÄúThe Detroit of India‚Äù, is a bustling city with diverse neighborhoods. As a business owner, choosing the right location for your establishment is crucial. This project leverages data science techniques to help you make informed decisions.

Business Problem
The central question we address is: Where should you establish your business in Chennai? To answer this, we consider factors such as neighborhood characteristics, existing venues, and local demographics.

Data Sources
We utilize the following data sources:

Neighborhood Data: A dataset containing a list of neighborhoods in Chennai along with their latitude and longitude coordinates.
Foursquare API: We access venue information within each neighborhood, including restaurants, hotels, shopping centers, and more.

Gather neighborhood data and explore its structure.
Set up the Foursquare API connection.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and organize the neighborhood data.
Retrieve venue information using Foursquare.

Clustering:
Apply k-means clustering to group neighborhoods based on venue similarity.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using silhouette scores.

Highlight areas suitable for specific business categories.
